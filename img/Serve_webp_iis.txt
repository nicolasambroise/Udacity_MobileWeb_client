How to Enable WebP on IIS
1. Launch IIS Manager.
2. Click on your main server on the left pane to make sure we’re making the change on a server level (as opposed to a site level). Then click on the MIME Types.
3. On the right pane of MIME Types dialog box, click on Add… link.
4. We want to add a new MIME type of WebP as an image type so IIS knows how to handle this new format.
In Add MIME Type box, enter .webp as the file name extension and image/webp as the MIME type and click OK.
5.Now if you reload your Chrome browser, you should be able to see both image files rendered correctly.
